    "\n",
    "Prompt Template Prompting refers to a technique where predefined templates are used to construct effective prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to generate responses tailored to specific use cases. The templates typically contain static text combined with dynamic input variables, allowing for consistent, reusable, and customizable prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt templates are widely used across various domains, such as:\n",
    "* **Question Generation**: Templates can generate quiz questions by filling in variables related to topics.\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Static instructions combined with variable documents or inputs allow flexible summarization.\n",
    "* **Coding Assistance**: Dynamic prompts help LLMs generate code snippets for different programming tasks.\n",

By separating concerns into distinct modules, we can improve scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. While there are challenges associated with this approach, careful planning and communication among developers can help overcome these limitations and ensure the success of the project.\\n\\nThis document outlines a modular architecture design that includes core, functional, and integration modules. Each module serves a specific purpose and can be developed and maintained independently, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability in the long run. By following this approach, we can build a robust and maintainable platform that meets the needs of our users.\\n    \\n    Format your response exactly as follows:\\n    Clarity: [score]/10\\n    Completeness: [score]/10\\n    Technical Accuracy: [score]/10\\n    Specificity: [score]/10\\n    Feasibility: [score]/10\\n    Overall: [average score]/10\\n    \\n    Explanation: [brief justification for scores and specific improvement suggestions]\\n    ', 'stream': False, 'options': {'temperature': 0.4}}\n",

While these technologies can facilitate real-time communication, they require additional setup and configuration to achieve seamless integration.\\n\\nSpecificity: 5/10\\n\\nMany requirements feel vague or open-ended, making it difficult to determine concrete implementation details. For example, the \"resource sharing module\" could be implemented using various cloud storage services, but no specific details are provided on how to integrate these services with the Discord bot.\\n\\nFeasibility: 4/10\\n\\nSome modules seem overly ambitious or require significant resources to implement effectively. For instance, developing an AI-powered feedback system that provides instant feedback on user work may be challenging and resource-intensive. Additionally, integrating with popular LMS platforms could be complex and time-consuming.\\n\\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\nWhile the modular architecture design is a good starting point, it requires more specificity, technical accuracy, and feasibility considerations to ensure successful implementation. Recommendations include:\\n\\n* Break up lengthy sections into smaller paragraphs\\n* Provide more concrete details on implementation strategies and edge cases\\n* Clarify overlapping or redundant modules\\n* Conduct thorough feasibility assessments for each module\\n* Consider seeking input from experts in relevant fields (e.g., AI, LMS platforms) to ensure technical accuracy.\\n    \\n    Create an improved version of the prompt that addresses the weaknesses identified in the critique\\n    while maintaining its strengths.

Additionally, implement a bug bounty program to encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.\\n2. **Scalability**: Plan for horizontal scaling (adding more servers) and vertical scaling (increasing server resources). Consider using containerization (e.g., Docker) to manage dependencies and improve performance.\\n3. **Integration Complexity**: When integrating with external services, ensure that the implementation is modular, maintainable, and flexible. Use APIs and SDKs provided by these platforms to simplify interactions.\\n4. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks key metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory allocation, network latency). This will help identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the system's resources.\\n\\n**Next Steps**\\n\\nTo further refine this architecture, I recommend:\\n\\n1. **Define technical requirements**: Break down each module into smaller, specific requirements, and prioritize them based on importance and complexity.\\n2. **Develop a technology stack**: Choose a set of technologies that align with your requirements and are well-suited for the project's scope (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Docker).\\n3. **Create a design document**: Outline the system's architecture, including high-level overviews, component interactions, and data flow.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can create a more detailed, functional design that will serve as a foundation for building your Discord bot.\\n    \\n    Format your response exactly as follows:\\n    Clarity: [score]/10\\n    Completeness: [score]/10\\n    Technical Accuracy: [score]/10\\n    Specificity: [score]/10\\n    Feasibility: [score]/10\\n    Overall: [average score]/10\\n    \\n    Explanation: [brief justification for scores and specific improvement suggestions]\\n    \", 'stream': False, 'options': {'temperature': 0.4}}\n",
